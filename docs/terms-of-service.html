    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Terminowo &mdash; Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
            By downloading, installing, or using Terminowo ("the App"), you agree to be bound by
            these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>
            Terminowo is a mobile application that allows you to scan documents using your device's
            camera, extract expiry dates through optical character recognition (OCR), and receive
            reminder notifications before those dates. The App stores all data locally on your device.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You are solely responsible for the documents you scan and the data stored on your device.</li>
            <li>You must not use the App for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and your Google account used for authentication.</li>
            <li>You must not attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or tamper with the App.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Google Account and Authentication</h2>
        <p>
            The App requires a Google account to authenticate with Google Document AI for OCR
            processing. By using this feature, you also agree to
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google's Terms of Service</a>.
            You are responsible for keeping your Google account credentials secure.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. OCR and Date Extraction</h2>
        <p>
            The App uses automated optical character recognition to extract dates from scanned
            documents. While we strive for accuracy, OCR results are provided on an "as-is" basis
            and may contain errors. You should always verify extracted dates against the original
            document. The App is intended as a convenience tool and should not be relied upon as
            the sole source of truth for critical deadlines.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Notifications and Reminders</h2>
        <p>
            The App schedules reminder notifications locally on your device. Delivery of
            notifications depends on your device settings, operating system, and battery
            optimization policies. We do not guarantee that notifications will be delivered at the
            exact scheduled time or at all. You should not rely solely on the App's reminders for
            time-sensitive obligations.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Your use of the App is also governed by our
            <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes how data is handled.
            All user data is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, store, or have
            access to your documents or personal information on any server.
        </p>
    </div>
